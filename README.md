# Plugin do QGIS

These are two internal plugins developed for PEC Energia S.A. by the repository author, exclusively for QGIS.

1-The "EER Fundiario" plugin offers functionalities for calculating buffer overlaps with polygons (partially implemented) and a routine for generating .kmz files in a desired model, organizing the items into folders and subfolders as required by the company.

2-The "EER Engenharia" plugin provides custom routines to assist with interactions with the EOL validator, offering tools and features that streamline the validation process.

Both plugins aim to enhance the company's workflow by providing specific functionalities tailored to their needs. The "EER Fundiario" plugin focuses on land-related operations, while the "EER Engenharia" plugin is designed to aid in tasks related to interactions with the EOL validator. Together, they contribute to increased efficiency and effectiveness in various aspects of PEC Energia S.A.'s operations.

## Key Features
-Import of .kmz files containing information about land property statuses.
-Import and reading of .xlsx files with data from the EOL validator.
-Integration of data from .kmz and .xlsx files to cross-reference the information and obtain a comprehensive view.
-Visualization of the results in Google Earth, allowing spatial analysis and manipulation of the integrated data.

These key features provide a powerful toolset for PEC Energia S.A., enabling the company to efficiently manage and analyze land-related information and EOL validation data. The integration of .kmz and .xlsx files allows for a seamless flow of data, facilitating data-driven decision-making and providing a comprehensive understanding of the status and characteristics of land properties and wind energy projects.

The visualization capabilities in Google Earth further enhance the analysis process by providing a geospatial context to the data. This spatial visualization allows for easy identification of patterns, relationships, and potential issues, which can lead to more informed and optimized strategies for land use and wind energy development.

Overall, these main features contribute to streamlining workflows, improving data management, and supporting effective decision-making in PEC Energia S.A.'s operations.
