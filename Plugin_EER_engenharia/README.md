# Plugin EER engenharia
## Context

I noticed that I could help in the day-to-day engineering tasks with some Python routines, especially when I was assigned to handle EOL validator activities. So, I developed an implementation of a submenu that executes files file1_1, file1_2, ..., file4_1. The idea behind this was as follows: the company uses SharePoint for file sharing, so if I placed the files in a shared folder, any changes made to the individual codes would be synchronized through SharePoint and reflected in the user's local directory.

One of the tasks of many energy companies is to validate transmission lines, properties, wind turbines, interference cones, etc. The regulatory agency ANEEL validates this on its website: https://sigel.aneel.gov.br/validadoreol/.

## Implementation

The routines developed and executed by the plugin are:

1) Operations with spreadsheets are performed to read from or insert data into the EOL validator spreadsheets, which serve as an interface between QGIS and the EOL validator).

Description: The plugin reads the spreadsheets generated by the EOL validator and prepares the data for delivery, which is a crucial task. It generates the properties, wind turbines, transmission lines, and interference cones for submission.

file1_1:
"Excel to QGIS"

Usage: Enter the folder path where the EOL validator spreadsheets and SIRGAS are located.

Output: Polygons in QGIS.

file1_2:
"QGIS to Excel"

Usage: Enter the folder path where you want to save the Excel file.

Output: A spreadsheet containing the compilation of Parks and Substations (polygons) and Transmission Lines (LT).

2)Operations with .shp files (Load and Save features)

Description: Loads .shp files from folders and subfolders and saves .shp files in folders.

Reads files from folders and subfolders and
file2_1:
"Reading .shp files"

Usage: Enter the folder path where you want to read the .shp files from folders and subfolders.

Output: Polygons in QGIS.

file2_2:
"Generate .shp files"

Usage: Enter the folder path where you want to save the .shp files from folders and subfolders.

Output: .shp files of the polygons from QGIS.

3)Operations with overlaps

Description: ANEEL does not allow any overlaps between polygons and does not permit sending buffers outside the properties. Thus, it was necessary to verify which polygons and buffers needed adjustments.

file3_1:
"Check buffers"
Usage: Enter the SIRGAS UTM of the wind turbine points, and the name of the aeros layout in QGIS.

Output: Prints in the QGIS Python prompt of the buffer and polygon overlaps.

file3_2:
"Check park overlaps"
Usage: Simply execute the routine without any inputs.

Output: Prints in the QGIS Python prompt of the polygon overlaps.

4) Shadowing Operation

 Description: On the EOL validator website, it is possible to observe interference cones. However, these cones are only constructed when wind turbines are inserted into the system. Therefore, it would be very beneficial to have this information beforehand (to place the wind turbines in the correct position, etc.). But what are interference cones? In fluid dynamics, such as with the wind, there is an effect called "wake effect" [Source: Wikipedia - Wake (physics)], which generates a zone of high wind turbulence, making the presence of wind turbines in this zone unusable. This zone is called "interference cones," and ANEEL stipulates that there should be no other wind turbines in this area.

file4_1:
"Interference cones"
Subroutines: The subroutines for this file are in the 'shadowing' folder.
Usage: Enter the path where the spreadsheet named 'Planilha de entrada.xlsx' is located. This is a standard spreadsheet that contains the necessary information for calculating the interference cones. This information can be found in ANEEL's documentation. You can choose to enter the turbine points directly into the spreadsheet or use a QGIS layout.
Output: Interference cones in QGIS for the wind turbine points.
